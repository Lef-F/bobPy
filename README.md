# Welcome to Bob's workshop 🛠

Bob is currently upgrading his business to use [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) like all the other cool workshops in 2022. 👷‍♂️

## Install

- The poetic way: `poetry install`

- Otherwise: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Run

Bob likes this streamlit simplicity:

`streamlit run run.py`

## That's it for now

Have a wonderful day! 🤩
